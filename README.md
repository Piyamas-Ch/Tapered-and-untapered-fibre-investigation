This Github presents additional results for the manuscript Choochalerm et al., 2021 'Transmission properties of tapered optical fibres: simulations and experimental measurements' (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yofte.2021.102632) and Choochalerm et al., 2023 'Incoherent light in tapered graded-index fibre: A study of transmission and modal noise' (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yofte.2022.103140)


Experimental results of transmission agiants with effective numerical aperture of untapered fibres are presented in the folder Untapered fibre results.


Step-index and Graded-index Tapered fibre simulations by COMSOL and Zemax

Each folder contains the parameters file for COMSOL/Zemax, together with a describtion of the parameters. A 
screenshot from the running programs is included.

*The fibre test setup simulation is in the Zemax folder.
