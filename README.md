This Github presents additional results for the manuscript Choochalerm et al., 2021 'Transmission properties of tapered optical fibres: simulations and experimental measurements' (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yofte.2021.102632) and Choochalerm et al., 2023 'Incoherent light in tapered graded-index fibre: A study of transmission and modal noise' (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yofte.2022.103140)

The following three folders are explained as following:
1. COMSOL: This folder contains simulation file of 5:1 graded-index tapered fibre in 3D by COMSOL(can be downloaded from star.herts.ac.uk/exohspec/3dGIStd9level.mph), Parameter of the simulation description (denoted 'ComcolPara.txt'), COMSOL interface examples (denoted 'Consol_UI.jpg' and 'Comsol_mode4_GI_0.20t.pspimage') 

2. Untapered-fibre-results: This folder contains additional experimental results of untapered fibre. There are 1. Table of specification of test fibres (denote 'tbA-1_untaper-des.JPG'), 2. Table of transmission results of test fibres (denote 'tbA-2_untaper-TvsNAresults.JPG'), and Transmission versus NAeff of test fibre results (denote 'untaper_TvsNA.pdf')

3. Zemax: This folder contains simulation files of 5:1 graded-index and step-index tapered fibre in 3D by Zemax. The transmission dependent on effective NA test setup simulation is also included here. Zemax simulation files are in .ZDA and .zmx. 
  - '50_gi5to1_taper_down_grin_20052020.ZDA' and '50_gi5to1_taper_down_grin_20052020.zmx' are 5:1 graded-index tapered fibre simulation files.
  - 'si5to1_taper_down201119.ZDA' and 'si5to1_taper_down201119.zmx' are 5:1 graded-index tapered fibre simulation files.
  - 'Zemax_parameter.txt' is parameters description in Zemax models.
  - 'paraxial_fibre_setup.ZDA' and 'paraxial_fibre_setup.zmx'are transmission dependent on effective NA test setup simulation files.
  - 'Gaussian-spot_calculations.JPG' is a results of spot size variation impact by the truncated gaussian beam from the transmission dependent on effective NA test setup.
  - 'zemax-screenshot.JPG is a screenshot from Zemax user interface.
